# b3d_mailbox_flap
Parametric 3D model of a mailbox flap, made with [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d).  

[OCP CAD Viewer for VS Code](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer) was used for code development.  
This code is licensed under the [GPL v3](LICENSE).  

This mailbox flap, although parametric, is best suited to a standard French mailbox.  
We strongly recommend that you print it in a weather-resistant material, perhaps ASA, PETG, etc.  
When printing, orient the length of the flap along the Z axis, to avoid supports and, above all, the impossibility of managing clearance for the support bar.  
Once printed, this mailbox flap can be installed as a replacement for the old flap, on an aluminum rod.
